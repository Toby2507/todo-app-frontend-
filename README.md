### What I learned

I learnt how to utilize HTML5 drag functionality and It was a very insightfull endeavour and I got to work with events alot hence, I was able to gain better understanding about event bubbling, hoisting and DOM manipulation.

### Continued development

This is my final project before starting my react journey and I finally finished it so I'm starting React as soon as possible. Learning never stops.
